 Recreation of Arthur Zimek work paper to generate the distances between sequence of 100 points, with uniform distribution in [0,1], find the "average" (statistical moment 1 mean) distance  and graph the relative frequency of pairs of points using histograms.

Procedure:
1. Generate a sequence of 100 points, with uniform distribution in [0,1].  
2. Find the “average” distance between two points chosen at random in the interval [0,1].  
3. Graph the relative frequency of pairs of points located at a distance d.
